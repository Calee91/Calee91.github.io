					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> [INSERT YOUR WIREFRAMES HERE] </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Wireframe1.JPG" />
							<p>Youtube</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> [INSERT YOUR WIREFRAMES HERE] </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Improved.JPG" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to make the user stay on the site as long as possible. It is intended for creators and users from all age ranges. This design accomplishes this by offering a variety of content for the user to stay on the site.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I would add a 2 by three video on the main page because there would be randomly missing videos when you scrolled down. The two videos when scrolling down was massive so shrank down video size. I would add a shorts for subscriptions more easily to access because you can't access multiple shorts that easily from creators that you like.  </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>

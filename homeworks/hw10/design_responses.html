							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I never knew that there was debate on how attention worked. I thought that sustained attention section was interesting. I related this to keeping white space and why white space is important. It strengthened my opinion in the way that white space is good. I guess that bold colors and contrast is some good examples.</p>

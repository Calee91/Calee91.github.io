        Hi! My name is Cameron and I love to eat fried rice. I like to watch Youtube and read manga in my freetime. One thing that I'm watching on Youtube is terrarium building.

        <h1>Part 2: Reading Responses</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>All choices of a website are deliberate. The choices the developer has made were meant to be engaged with the user. </li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was using examples that were popular. The interface of Twitter was unexpected and I never noticed the phrasing “‘Add another Tweet’”.</li>
            <li>I found this way of thinking interesting, “As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product”.
            </li>
            <li>6 because it explained the concepts briefly and concisely. </li>
        </ol>

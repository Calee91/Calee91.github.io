					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There is a specific time frame that is optimal for the human brain takes to recognize. It is between 200ms and 500ms. Some animation should be avoided such as adding motion blur to animation. These animations have a lot to do with human behavior. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the easy comparisons the animation does. You can tell more easily what animations are and see for yourself why it is better. I had an "ah ha" moment when seeing the difference as I couldn't imagine the animation if I just read text. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

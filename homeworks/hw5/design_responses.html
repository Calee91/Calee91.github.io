                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something that I learned was that the animations should add to the page. They shouldn't be too long to mess with the functionality of the website. It should enhance how the page works. Animations could be used for different things like the home page or sliding into a new page. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was seeing the different kinds of animation there were. I never thought that the sliding to another thing on a website was an animation. It expanded what I would consider what to put animation on a page for.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the easygrowio app preview animation where they slide the screen. I liked it because the animations were all in the same style. Each animation didn't take too long to load and fullfiled its purpose of getting to the next page. It achived its goal in a delightful manner by being smooth and seemless instead of being laggy. </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would score it a 7 because I enjoyed watching the different animations go by and not that much reading. </p>
